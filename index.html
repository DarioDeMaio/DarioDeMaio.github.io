                <h1>Dario De Maio</h1>
                <p>Hi! I'm Dario De Maio, a Master's student in Computer Science at Università degli Studi di Salerno, specializing in cloud computing ☁️.</p>

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I'm deeply interested in cloud computing and artificial intelligence. What fascinates me the most about cloud computing is its ability to help organizations transition from capital expenditures to operational expenditures with minimal friction, allowing them to enter the market more quickly and scale globally with ease.</p>
                <p>Lately, I’ve been focusing on AI, particularly Machine Learning and Deep Learning. My main areas of interest include Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs), as reflected in my GitHub projects.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>My Tech Experience</h2>
                <p>I have experience working with a wide range of technologies and programming languages, both through commissioned projects and independent work. For backend development, I frequently use Spring, while for frontend development, I often work with Angular, although the choice of framework always depends on the specific project requirements.</p>
                <p>Additionally, Docker is an essential tool in my workflow, helping me containerize applications and avoid compatibility issues.</p>
                <p>As mentioned earlier, I am also deeply involved in studying Machine Learning and Neural Networks. In particular, I am fascinated by Generative AI and have explored this field through various projects. One such project includes developing a simple LSTM-based music generator using MIDI files.</p>
